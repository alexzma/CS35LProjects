Q1.
This patch worsens the performance of ls, because the code in ls no longer use
s the if statement to check whether ignore mode is default when the tag -A is u
sed. Now, the code always uses the ignore mode of IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT when it
 has the -A tag.
In my directory, la used the unpatched "ls -a" command.
la2 used the patched "ls -a" command.
When running the command "time ./la", the time was usually 0.004 seconds.
When running the command "time ./la2", the time was usually 0.005 seconds.
Therefore, the patched ls is slower when using only the -a tag.
When running the command "time ./la -A", the time was usually 0.004 seconds.
When running the command "time ./la2 -A", the time was usually 0.005 seconds.
The patched ls is also slower when using both the -a and -A tags.

Q2.
If a company adopts the patched version of Coreutils instead of the default one
, there might be a problem when	transferring codes between machines.
If there are machines with the unpatched version, they will have different beha
viors of ls compared to the patched versions, so they will have	 unexpected ver
sions if they are given code based on the patched versions.

Q3.
An index out of range error is thrown, because an empty file has no lines, so t
rying to extract any line from an empty file causes an out of bounds error.

Q4.
A syntax error occurs with Python 3, because the script is written in Python 2 
syntax for the exception format, and Python 2 exception format is incompatible 
with Python 3 exception format.
