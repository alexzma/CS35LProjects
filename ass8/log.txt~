First, I plugged in the BeagleBone.
Then, I installed the drivers on my computer.
To finish the installation, I used the command 
"sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext" and restarted my 
computer.

After that, I used the command "sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2" to log into my 
BeagleBone.
Then, I opened the connmanctl terminal with the command "connmanctl"
Then, I ran the command "enable wifi"
That command allows the BeagleBone to connect to wifi networks.
Then, I used the command "scan wifi" so the BeagleBone would look for wifi networks.
I ran the command "services" to list all the wifi networks the BeagleBone found.
I used the command "connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk"
to connect to the class wifi.
When the passphrase request came, I entered the password "3760ClassNet"
After that, I quit the terminal with the command "quit"

Then, I ran the commands "sudo apt-get update", "sudo apt-get install xauth", 
"sudo apt-get install xvfb", and "sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb".
Those commands updated the software, installed xauth, installed xvfb, and installed firefox, respectively.

I also used the command "nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config" to edit the file /etc/ssh/ssh_config
In that file, I changed the ForwardAgent and ForwardX11 fields to yes.
I used the command "nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config" to edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
In that file, I changed the X11Forwarding field to yes.
These changes allowed my BeagleBone to use X11 Forwarding

I checked if my BeagleBone had OpenSSH with the command 
"dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh"
It output:
openssh-client
openssh-server
openssh-sftp-server

This means that openssh was installed.

After this, I set up my server.
First, I used the command "ssh-keygen" to create keys.
I input a phrase to help the key generate.

Note:

Then, I made the client account directory with the command "sudo useradd -d /home/dirname -m username"
I set the password with the command "sudo passwd password"
I entered the client's directory with the command "cd /home/dirname"
I made the .ssh directory with the command "sudo mkdir .ssh"
I changed the ownership of the .ssh directory with the command
"sudo chown -R username .ssh"
This changes the owner of .ssh to username
I changed the permission of the .ssh directory with the command
"sudo chmod 700 .ssh"
This gives the owner of the directory read, write, and execute permissions.

After that, my partner Kayla logged into my server.
First, she generated her own keys using the command "ssh-keygen" and entering 
a phrase.
Then, I used the command "ifconfig" to find my BeagleBone's IP address.
My IP address was 10.97.85.122
Then, she pinged my BeagleBone with the command "ping 10.97.85.122"
That tested if my BeagleBone was on the same network.
It was on the same network.
Then, she copied her BeagleBone's public key to my BeagleBone with the command 
"ssh-copy-id -i username@10.97.85.122"
She entered her password.
Then, she added her private key to the authentication agent with "ssh-add".
She used the command "ssh -X username@10.97.85.122" to log into my server.
She entered her password.

Then, we tested if changes on my BeagleBone registered on Kayla's BeagleBone 
and changes sent to my BeagleBone registered.
I made a file named hi in her directory, and it showed up in Kayla's display 
when she checked.
Then, she made a file named people.txt in her directory, and it showed up in 
my display when I checked.

Then, she ran the command "firefox" and firefox opened on her computer.
