1.
First, I made a file named tr2b.c
In the program, I specified that there should be two arguments.
If there are not two errors, the program throws an error.
Then, I created a char array with default values of 0.
The array is size 128, and each location corresponds to a character.
I looped through the first argument, and placed their values into their positio
n in the array. If there are duplicates, the program throws an error.
I initialized each location in the array to the value of its position.
Then, I read the values of the arguments.
If the arguments are not the same length, the program throws an error.
If they are the same length, the program, using the char array, maps each chara
cter in the second argument to the character in the first argument with the sam
e position.
Then, the program reads in characters from standard input using getchar, finds 
the corresponding transliteration character, and then outputs the character usi
ng putchar.

2.
I made a copy of tr2b.c named tr2u.c
In the new file, I changed getchar call to the equivalent read call.
I also changed the putchar call to the equivalent write call.

3.
I created a 5000000 byte file with the command head --bytes=5000000 /dev/urando
m > bigfile.txt
I compiled my tr2b.c file into an executable called tr2b
I compiled my tr2u.c file into an executable called tr2u

a)
To compare the system calls when copying one file to another, I first used the 
command strace -c ./tr2b 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt >bigfile2.txt
That command listed 611 calls to write, 613 calls to read, 9 calls to mmap, 4 c
alls to mprotect, 2 calls to open, 1 call to brk, 1 call to munmap, 2 calls to 
close, 4 calls to fstat, 1 call to access, 1 call to execve, and 1 call to arch
_prctl.

Then, I removed bigfile2.txt with the command rm bigfile2.txt
I used the command strace -c ./tr2u 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt >bigfile2.txt
That command listed 5000000 calls to write, 5000002 calls to read, 7 calls to m
map, 4 calls to mprotect, 2 calls to open, 4 calls to brk, 1 call to munmap, 2 
calls to close, 2 calls to fstat, 1 call to access, 1 call to execve, and 1 cal
l to arch_prctl.

The unbuffered version used more calls to write, read, and brk compared to the 
buffered version. On the other hand, the buffered version used more calls to mm
ap and fstat. Since write, read, and brk are called so much more often than mma
p and fstat, the buffered version is more efficient in system calls than the un
buffered version.

b)
To compare the system calls when copying a file to my terminal, I first used th
e command strace -c ./tr2b 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt
That command listed 19880 calls to write, 613 calls to read, 9 calls to mmap, 4
calls to mprotect, 2 calls to open, 1 call to brk, 1 call to munmap, 2 calls to
close, 4 calls to fstat, 1 call to access, 1 call to execve, and 1 call to arch
_prctl.

Then, I used the command strace -c ./tr2u 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt
That command listed 5000000 calls to write, 5000002 calls to read, 7 calls to m
map, 4 calls to mprotect, 2 calls to open, 4 calls to brk, 1 call to munmap, 2 
calls to close, 2 calls to fstat, 1 call to access, 1 call to execve, and 1 cal
l to arch_prctl.

The unbuffered version used more calls to write, read, and brk compared to the 
buffered version. On the other hand, the buffered version used more calls to mm
ap and fstat compared to the unbuffered version. Since write, read, and brk are
called so much more often than mmap and fstat, the buffered version is more eff
icient in system calls than the unbuffered version.

Copying one file to another is more efficient than copying a file to the termin
al in terms of system calls when using the buffered version, because there are 
fewer calls to write and read when copying a file to another with the buffered 
version compared to copying a file to the terminal with the buffered version.

Copying one file to another is equally efficient to copying a file to the termi
nal in terms of system calls when using the unbuffered version, because they ha
ve the same number of the same system calls.

4.
I removed the file bigfile2.txt again.
Then, I used the command time ./tr2b 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt >bigfile2.txt
The real time of the command was 0.155 seconds.
The user time of the command was 0.093 seconds.
The system time of the command was 0.005 seconds.

I removed the file bigfile2.txt once more.
Then, I used the command time ./tr2u 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt >bigfile2.txt
The real time of the command was 9.993 seconds.
The user time of the command was 1.238 seconds.
The system time of the command was 8.709 seconds.

Then, I used the command time ./tr2b 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt
The real time of the command was 0.835 seconds.
The user time of the command was 0.127 seconds.
The system time of the command was 0.100 seconds.

Then, I used the command time ./tr2u 'a' 'b' <bigfile.txt
The real time of the command was 9.003 seconds.
The user time of the command was 1.282 seconds.
The system time of the command was 7.700 seconds.

In all corresponding measurements of time, the unbuffered version was faster th
an the buffered version.

Homework:
I made a program called sfrobu that allocates memory all at once for input file
s.
After allocating the memory for the file, it reads the file byte by byte until
it reaches the end of the file, allocating more memory if needed.

Then, I created files with zero, 100, 10000, and 1000000 lines, each with 1 cha
racter, and then I frobnicated them.

Then, I timed the original sfrob and the sfrobu programs with those files as in
put.
sfrob with 0 lines:
real time: 0.002 seconds
user time: 0.000 seconds
system time: 0.001 seconds

sfrobu with 0 lines:
real time: 0.002 seconds
user time: 0.001 seconds
system time: 0.000 seconds

sfrob with 100 lines:
real time: 0.002 seconds
user time: 0.001 seconds
system time: 0.001 seconds

sfrobu with 100 lines:
real time: 0.002 seconds
user time: 0.000 seconds
system time: 0.002 seconds

sfrob with 10000 lines:
real time: 0.055 seconds
user time: 0.052 seconds
system time: 0.001 seconds

sfrobu with 10000 lines:
real time: 0.033 seconds
user time: 0.012 seconds
system time: 0.020 seconds

sfrob with 1000000 lines:
real time: 15.901 seconds
user time: 14.910 seconds
system time: 0.086 seconds

sfrobu with 1000000 lines:
real time: 4.049 seconds
user time: 2.017 seconds
system time: 2.018 seconds

The sfrobu program in general has a slower system time, but a faster user time,
 compared to sfrob.
Also, as the number of lines increased, the sfrobu program became more efficien
t than the sfrob program. This is because the sfrob program reallocates memory
for every byte in the file, while the sfrobu program only allocates memory once
. This makes the sfrobu program more efficient when there are more bytes of mem
ory to allocate.

After that, I changed the sfrob program to print out the number of comparison
s rather than the sorted input.
I recompiled sfrob and ran the files through the program again.
With 0 lines, there were zero comparisons.
With 100 lines, there were 549 comparisons.
With 10000 lines, there were 121469 comparisons.
With 1000000 lines, there were 18823876 comparisons.
Plotting the lines to the comparisons on a graph showed that the relation betwe
en lines and the number of comparisons is approximately Nlog2(N) comparisons pe
r line.

I changed the sfrob program back to its original form and recompiled it.
Then, I tested the sfrob, sfrobu, and sfrobs programs with and without the -f t
ags on the files with 0, 100, 10000, and 1000000 lines mentioned earlier.
The outputs were printed to the terminal, and the times for the programs were:

system time: 0.001 seconds

sfrobu with 0 lines:

system time: 0.046 seconds

The programs with the -f tag were always slower than the corresponding programs
 without the -f tag when processing the same file.
With 0 lines, the sfrob and sfrobu programs were similar in efficiency to each
other, and more efficient than the sfrobs program.
With 100 lines, the sfrob and sfrobu programs were still similar in efficiency
to each other, and more efficient than the sfrobs program.
With 10000 lines, the sfrobs program was significantly more efficent than the s
frob and sfrobu programs. The sfrobu program was significantly more efficient t
han the sfrob program.
With 1000000 lines, the sfrobs program was significantly more efficient than th
e sfrob and sfrobu programs. The sfrobu program was significantly more efficien
t than the sfrob program.

The previous times were with the files as standard input. Now, I used cat to pu
t the files into standard output, and piped that output into my programs.
The resulting times were:

Like before, the programs with the -f tag were slower than the corresponding pr
ograms without the -f tag when processing the same files.
With 0 and 100 lines, the sfrob and sfrobu programs were similarly efficent, an
d were more efficient than the sfrobs program.
With 10000 lines, the sfrobs program was the most efficient, and sfrobu was the
 least efficient.
With 1000000 lines, the sfrobs program was the most efficient, and sfrobu was t
he least efficient.

The sfrobu program becomes less efficient when taking input not directly from a
 file, because it only allocates all the memory at once when the input is a re
gular file. When the input is not a regular file, sfrobu must allocate the memo
ry every time a new byte is read, which is less efficient than all at once.
